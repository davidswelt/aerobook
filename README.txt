Aero Log

An electronic pilot's logbook for gliding/general aviation

This is a simple logbook, primarily for glider pilots and other private pilots who need to track their flying.
It makes adding up times simple and shows 30/90-day currency.

It is written in Excel, which helps you maintain the data openly in a relatively future-proof way.


New versions will be available here:

Please send your own revisions if they could be useful for others.  Also, send bug reports.

This software comes without expressed or implied warranty for any purpose.  Use at your own risk.


Requirements: Microsoft Excel (recent version).
Built with MS Office 2011 (Mac).
